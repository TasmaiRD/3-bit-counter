# 3-bit-counter
These types of counters fall under the category of synchronous controller counter.
Here the mode control input is used to decide whether which sequence will be generated by the counter.
In this case, mode control input is used to decide whether the counter will perform up counting or down counting.
Designing of such a counter is the same as designing a synchronous counter but the extra combinational logic for mode control input is required.
